"""Announcements: a staff role sends a notice to a set of audience roles.

Rules the server enforces (the screen only shows what comes back):
- Who may send is the ``announcements.write`` permission; who sees a notice is its audience (role codes), the
  sender's own role, the person who created it, and Super Admin / Managing Director. Anyone else gets 404.
- ``Sent By`` is the sender's role name, set here - the client cannot name someone else.
- The audience is the school's default broadcast list; it is never taken from the request.
- One optional attachment (PDF, JPG or PNG, up to 5 MB, content checked). It downloads only for people who
  can see the announcement.
- A reader acknowledges at most once, and may leave replies. The sender (and anyone who can send) sees all
  replies; everyone else sees only their own.
- Creating a notice fans a notification out to each audience role except the sender's, and is audited.
